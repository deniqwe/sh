#  Description:
#    Provides a basic script to automate enabling and disabling websites found
#    in the default configuration directories:
#      /etc/nginx/sites-available and /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
#    For easy access to this script, copy it into the directory:
#      /usr/local/sbin
#    Run this script without any arguments or with -h or --help to see a basic
#    help dialog displaying all options.
